# Face-Mask-detection-using-CNN
In recent trend wearing Face Mask has become an essential while roaming outside, approach of Deep Learning for Detecting Faces With and Without mask were a good trendy practice. Here I have created a model that detects face mask trained on 7553 images with 3 color channels (RGB).
The dataset is taken from Kaggle website.
